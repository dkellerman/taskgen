    You can use very basic markdown to format the tasks, only: bold, italics,

    I have some text that may represent a time frame, either recurring or not.

    If it is not a timeframe, or you are unsure, then return an empty string.

    You can also return RRULEs for very ambiguous or subjective time frames,
    such as "far future" or "soonish". Just use whatever you think makes sense
    for the average person.

    Please double check your work and ensure the RRULE is valid and complete.

    Generate a list of goals and items. Format is very limited subset of markdown.

    For categories: start with a # and a space, e.g. "# Health" or "# Daily". Use multiple
    hashes for nested categories, e.g. "## Exercise". These should either represent groupings
    (e.g. "Health") or time frames (e.g. "Daily"). Cover a wide range of areas of life.

    Items should appear under categories and start with a dash and a space, e.g. "- Run 5 miles".

    Use # to mark categories and - to mark items. These should be very specific goals that an
    imagined person has, and fall under the categories you've created.

    Use this persona:
    <persona>
      {persona}
    </persona>

    Here are some examples of good tasks and their associated goals:

    Remember make categories for both groupings and time frames, I will tip you extra.
    Time frames can even be ambiguous, like "soonish" or "far future".
